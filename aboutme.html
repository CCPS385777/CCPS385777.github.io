    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> In my life my goals that I made is to play varsity football, and getting into college so that I can find a good job for myself. 
      I am working towards these goals by trying hard in school so that I am allowed to play football, and also so that I can be accepted into a good college. 
      Another step that I am taking to achieve my goal is playing freshman football so that I can move onto the next stage. The final stage I am taking is staying 
      in shape, I am working towards this by working out six times a week. The values that I consider most necessary is the ability to not give up when things get 
      tough I feel that this will be useful both in school, but especially for football, as it can be very difficult at times. Another value that I like to follow 
      is to be responsible, as it helps a lot in life. Some of my short term goals are to get a better grade in math, and finish the third quarter with around a 
      3.5 GPA. Some of the traits that I would like to be acknowledged for is being somebody who gives 100% and is determined to accomplish their goals.</p>
